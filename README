SignPDF - a simple command line application to sign a PDF document.

SignPDF creates a config file if none exists and saves it under ~/.signpdf.

A JKS keystore with a cert signed by your desired CA is mandatory 
for use. Not mandatory, but a nice feature the tsa_url of a time 
stamp server in order to timestamp your documents.

The resulting PDF file will be signed and protected with allowed
restrictions to print, content copying and content copying for 
accessibility.
