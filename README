SignPDF - a simple iText based command line application to
sign a PDF document.

Features:

    * Signs a PDF document with a valid certificate
    * Encrypts/Protects a PDF document
    * Timestamps a PDF document (optional feature)
    * Supports different Config-Files defined by env. variable


All settings will be taken from ~/.signpdf configuration file. 
If no config file exist, a fresh config file will be created.

Alternatively the environment variable SIGNPDFRC can be used to
sign with different keys.

If you omit to leave plain passwords in the config file,
you will be prompted for password by running SignPDF.

A JKS keystore with a cert signed by your desired CA is mandatory 
for use. Not mandatory, but a nice feature the tsa_url of a time 
stamp server in order to timestamp your documents.

The resulting PDF file will be signed and protected with allowed
restrictions to print, content copying and content copying for 
accessibility.

Most of the crypto code is based on the iText docs at
  http://itextpdf.sourceforge.net/howtosign.html
